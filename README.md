# Footprint
An android application based on Kotlin to track the location of a user


### Introduction
In the present world, the number of crimes is increasing day by day, which makes a person anxious to know about the whereabouts of a 
family or friends when they are traveling to a remote place or not answering the calls and messages for an extended period.
If the person knows the whereabouts of a family member, it will make the person track them and make sure they are safe and sound. 
Since in the present world, most people carry GPS enabled mobile devices, I have developed an android application called Footprint, 
which enables the user to track their loved ones precisely and visualize their current location on a map to ensure that they are safe.
